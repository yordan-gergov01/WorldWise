# WorldWise üåç

WorldWise is a React-based application designed for tracking places (cities and countries) visited around the world. It allows users to interact with a real-world map, place markers, and save notes about their experiences. With additional features like city management, Wikipedia integration, and a placeholder authentication system, this app serves as an excellent learning project for React Router and Context API.

## Features

- **Interactive World Map:** Powered by Leaflet, users can search for and explore cities and countries.
- **Place Markers:** Users can add markers to the places they've visited and save personal notes or opinions about each location.
- **City Management:** Create, update, and delete city entries. When adding a new city, users can also choose a date and year of their visit via a detailed form.
- **Wikipedia Integration:** Fetch additional information about cities from Wikipedia.
- **Authentication:** A basic placeholder for login and logout, with future plans for full authentication.
- **Responsive Design:** Optimized for different screen sizes.
